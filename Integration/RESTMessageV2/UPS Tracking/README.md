This script calls the UPS tracking API.

UPS Developer Account:
Sign up at https://developer.ups.com
Create an App to get credentials
1. Client ID
2. Client Secret

How to use:
1. Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your UPS credentials.
2. Use the sandbox URL (wwwcie.ups.com) for testing and production URL (onlinetools.ups.com) for live data.
3. You can move this logic into a Script Include and call it from a Flow, Business Rule, or Catalog Client Script.
4. For security, store credentials in a Connection & Credential Alias and reference them in the script instead of hardcoding.
