The triggerDataSource() function eliminates the need for manually executing a Data Source from the UI.â€¨It programmatically triggers the import of a predefined Data Source record and loads the associated data into an Import Set table.
This function is typically used in:
* Scheduled Script Executions
* Flow Designer Actions.
