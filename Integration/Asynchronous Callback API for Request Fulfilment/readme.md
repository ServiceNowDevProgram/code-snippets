When a request is created in ServiceNow, it is essential to send the request details to a third-party system via an API gateway (such as GAMS or API Gateway) for fulfilment activities, such as access provisioning or record creation. Given the potential for lengthy processing times due to a high volume of activities, a synchronous integration may lead to timeouts. Therefore, leveraging asynchronous integration allows for efficient handling of such requests.


Benefits of Asynchronous Callback API:
    •	 Enhanced Performance: Asynchronous processing minimizes the risk of timeouts, ensuring that requests are handled efficiently, even when high volumes of activities are present.
    •	Improved User Experience: Users are not left waiting for synchronous responses; instead, they can continue working while the third-party system processes their requests.
    •	Reliable Status Tracking: The introduction of a dedicated status field allows for effective tracking of fulfilment outcomes, facilitating better communication with users regarding the success or failure of their requests.
    •	Scalability: This approach can easily scale to accommodate increased workloads and additional integrations with other systems, enhancing overall operational capacity.
    •	Flexibility in Integration: By decoupling request sending and status receiving, organizations can adapt to changes in third-party processes without disrupting their internal workflows.

This asynchronous callback API solution not only streamlines the integration process but also ensures that ServiceNow can effectively manage and track request fulfilment in a robust and user-friendly manner.
