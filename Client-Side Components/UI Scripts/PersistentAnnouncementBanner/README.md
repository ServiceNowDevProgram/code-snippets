This UI Script is used to inject a custom, highly visible, and persistent notification banner across the top of the entire ServiceNow platform interface. 

It is ideal for communicating critical, non-transactional system messages such as scheduled maintenance, major outages, or company-wide policy announcements.

The key feature of this banner is that it is dismissible, and it uses a User Preference to ensure that once a user closes a specific version of the announcement

The Reason to use this is , Announcements Banner Module Sometimes Loads Slower or Doesnt trigger the notification banner , instead this scripts all the time,if user is logged in
