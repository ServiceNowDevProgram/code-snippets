This is a super basic set of ui page and dynamic content block that can be added to a dashboard to allow users to select program records that will then load additional information, such as overall health and executive summary, into a content block.

Addition to-dos:
 1. The formatting is quite basic - you'll definitely need to apply some styles as per the instance design or customer preferences.
 2. Link to the program status report to allow for another layer of detail to be accessible
 3. Improve how users can interact with the program list

See attached image for example of what this looks like.
