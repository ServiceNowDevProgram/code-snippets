Edit Last Entered Work Notes/Additional comments

This UI action is built specifically to edit the last entered work notes/ additional comments by the user in incident form or it can modified for any table which support this journal fields.

There is some restriction around journal fields/ work notes as user cannot edit or adjust the work notes/additional comments that they entered. If they wish to edit it, I have introduced a new
UI action which calls the UI pages which will automatically populates the last entered work notes/comments and user can adjust and submit it.
