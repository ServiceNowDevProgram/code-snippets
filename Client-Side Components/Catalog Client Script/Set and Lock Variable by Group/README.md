**Set and Lock Variable by Group**

This solution provides a secure and dynamic way to control data entry on a Service Catalog form based on the user's group membership. It is typically used to pre-fill and lock certain justification or approval bypass fields for authorized users (like managers or executive staff), improving their efficiency while maintaining an accurate audit trail.

This functionality requires a combined Client-side (Catalog Client Script) and Server-side (Script Include) approach to ensure the group check is done securely.
