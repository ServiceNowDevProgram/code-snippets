This script will validate valid Adhaar number.
Adhaar is a 12 digit unique identification number issues by UIDAI in India.
The script will validate Adhaar through regex and if it is not valid, variable is cleared with field message.

With the help of this code you can easily validate the input value from the user and if it's not a email format you can clear and throw a error message below the variable. Of course you can use Email type variable as well but you cannot have a formatted error message.
