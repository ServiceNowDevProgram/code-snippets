This piece of code was written as a part of an usecase where the return date value validation was expected to be after start date as well as within 6 months from the start date. This code runs in an OnChange catalog client script for the field 'u_return_date' and validates the return date(u_return_date) in a ServiceNow Catalog item form to ensure:

1. A start date(u_start_date) is entered before setting a return date(u_return_date).
2. The return date is within 6 months after the start date.
3. Return date must be after the start date, it can't be same as it or before it.

Let’s say with an example:

a)
  u_start_date = 2025-10-01
  You enter u_return_date = 2026-04-15
  
  Steps:
  a)Difference = 196 days → More than 180 days
  b)Result: u_return_date is cleared and error shown: “Select Return Date within 6 months from Start Date”

b)
  u_start_date = 2025-10-02
  You enter u_return_date = 2025-10-01
  
  Steps:
  a)Difference = -1 day → Return date put as 1 day before start date
  b)Result: u_return_date is cleared and error shown: “Select Return Date in future than Start Date”
