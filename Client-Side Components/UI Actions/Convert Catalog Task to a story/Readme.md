Catalog task(sc_task)-to-Story Conversion UI Action

As a ServiceNow admin, I want to be able to convert catalog task into Development Stories with a single UI action so that operational issues can be seamlessly transitioned into Agile work items for remediation and platform improvement. 
Very helpful if requests requires development effort.
