Description:
This UI Action enables users to generate and download the current record in PDF format. It is particularly useful in the Incident table for PIR (Post-Incident Review) documents after resolution.

Pre-requisite:
A dedicated form view must be created containing all relevant fields such as Resolution Code, Resolution Notes, Assignment Group, Assigned To, and others required for comprehensive reporting.
In this code, I've used the view name called 'pdf_export' which is already created in the Incident table
