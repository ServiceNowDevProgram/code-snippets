Incident-to-Story Conversion UI Action

As a ServiceNow admin, I want to be able to convert incidents into Development Stories with a single UI action so that operational issues 
can be seamlessly transitioned into Agile work items for remediation and platform improvement.
Original incident can be closed with story number as a reference for the user.

Very helpful if incident requires development effort.
