This solution provides a significant User Experience (UX) enhancement for fields that store complex data in JSON format (e.g., integration payloads, configuration properties, or setup data). 

Instead of forcing users (developers, administrators) to read or edit raw, unformatted JSON in a plain text area, this macro adds a "JSON Viewer" button next to the field

Name	json_formatter_macro	
Active	true	
Type	XML

Navigate to **System UI > UI** Macros and create a new record named json_formatter_macro , Use XML Attached File as Script
