This solution dynamically provides users with real-time feedback on the length of a text input field (like short_description or a single-line text variable).
It immediately displays a character count beneath the field and uses visual cues to indicate when a pre-defined character limit has been reached or exceeded.

This is a vital User Experience (UX) enhancement that helps agents and users write concise, actionable information, leading to improved data quality and better integration reliability.
