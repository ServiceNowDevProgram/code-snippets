This ServiceNow client script is designed to validate file attachments on a form before submission. It's most likely used as a "Client Script" or "Client Script in a Catalog Item" that runs in the browser when a user tries to submit a form.

This client script runs when a form is submitted in ServiceNow. It checks if the user has:

Attached at least one file (shows an error if none).
Attached no more than three files (shows an error if more).
Only uploaded files of type PDF or PNG (shows an error for other types).
If any of these checks fail, the form submission is blocked and an appropriate error message is displayed.
