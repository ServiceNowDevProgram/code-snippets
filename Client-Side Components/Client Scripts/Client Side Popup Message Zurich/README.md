# Zurich info Message Example (Change Management)

# Overview
This Client Script demonstrates how to use the Zurich release info message types to provide real-time, colour-coded user feedback on the form.
It dynamically displays messages based on the record's Risk, Type, and State, improving visibility and user experience.

# Objective
To utilise Zurich's enhanced 'g_form' messaging APIs to display meaningful, colour-coded messages:
- Highlight mandatory fields
- Indicate workflow stage
- Provide feedback for risk and change types

Note: This can also be used in Incident, Problem, Request and other types of records.
