An `onLoad` client script that validates required fields in specific ServiceNow form views.

This ServiceNow client script provides automatic validation of required form fields when users access specific form views. The script runs immediately when a form loads and checks that critical fields are populated, displaying user-friendly error messages for any missing required information. This ensures data completeness and improves form submission success rates by catching validation issues early in the user workflow.

What This Script Does:
The onLoad client script performs comprehensive field validation with these key capabilities:
View-Specific Validation: Only triggers validation when accessing a designated form view
Multiple Field Support: Validates multiple required fields simultaneously in a single operation
Smart Field Detection: Uses field labels (not technical names) in error messages for better user experience
Consolidated Error Display: Shows all missing required fields in a single, clear error message
Immediate Feedback: Provides instant validation results as soon as the form loads
Non-Intrusive Design: Displays informational errors without blocking form interaction
