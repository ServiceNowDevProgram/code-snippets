**Dynamic Reference Qualifier with Filtering**
This Client Script provides a solution for dynamically updating the available options in a Reference Field based on the value selected in another field on the same form.

This technique is essential for ensuring data quality and improving the user experience (UX). 

A typical use case is filtering the Assignment Group field to show only groups relevant to the selected Service, Category, or Location.
