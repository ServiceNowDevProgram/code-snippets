# Display Section Based on State

## Overview
This client script dynamically displays specific sections on a form based on the selected State field value. It improves user experience by hiding or showing relevant sections as needed.

## How It Works
- When the State field changes, the script checks the new value.
- For Example, if the state is changed to "Resolved", the Resolution Section becomes visible.
- For other states, the section remains hidden.
