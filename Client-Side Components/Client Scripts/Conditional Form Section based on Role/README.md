# Conditional Form Sections Based on User Role

## Overview
This client script dynamically shows or hides specific sections of a form based on the logged-in userâ€™s role. It ensures that only authorized users, such as managers, can view and interact with sensitive sections (e.g., budget approvals).

## Use Case
- Managers: Can see the Budget Approval section.
- Other Users: The section remains hidden.

## How It Works
- The script runs onLoad of the form.
- It checks if the logged-in user has the specified role (manager in this example).
- If the user has the role, the Budget Approval section is shown. If not, it remains hidden.
