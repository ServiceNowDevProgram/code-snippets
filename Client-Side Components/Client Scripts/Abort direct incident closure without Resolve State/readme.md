ðŸ“˜ README â€” Incident State Validation (Client Script)
Overview

This Client Script enforces the correct ITIL incident lifecycle by preventing users from directly closing an incident without first transitioning it through the Resolved state.
If a user attempts to move the state directly to Closed Complete, the system reverts the change and displays a notification.

What This Code Does
Monitors changes to the state field on Incident form
Checks if new selection is trying to skip the Resolved step
Reverts state to its previous value when the rule is violated
Alerts the user with a clear and guided message
Refreshes the form to maintain data consistency
