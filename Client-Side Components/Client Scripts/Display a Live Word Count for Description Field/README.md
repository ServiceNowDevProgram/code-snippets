The script enhances a form field (specifically the description field) by:
-Adding a live word counter below the field.
-Visually warning the user if the word count exceeds 150 words.

This client-side script, intended for use in a ServiceNow form (e.g., catalog item or incident form), dynamically appends a custom `<div>` element below the `description` field to display a real-time word count. It leverages the `g_form.getControl()` API to access the field's DOM element and attaches an `input` event listener to monitor user input. The script calculates the word count by splitting the input text using a regular expression (`\s+`) and updates the counter accordingly. It applies conditional styling to the counter (`green` if â‰¤150 words, `red` if >150), providing immediate visual feedback to the user to enforce input constraints.
