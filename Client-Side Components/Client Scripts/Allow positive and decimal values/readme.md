Purpose of this script:

It matches positive numbers (integers or decimals)
It does not match 0 or 0.0 (i.e., it excludes non-positive numbers).

So this regex is used when you want to allow only positive (> 0) integer or decimal values.
It will give us the field message error if anyone tries to enter anything apart from the allowed values
