# Hide Start/Stop Timer on Record Table

## Purpose
Prevent users from clicking Start/Stop timer and letting it run while they are idle. The goal of this script was to encourage intentional time worked entries.

## How to Use
1. Create OnLoad client script (timeworkedhidetimer.js)
2. Adjust which table you want it on. In this case, it will be Incident table.
