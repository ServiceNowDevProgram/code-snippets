// The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

// Object is similar to Mapâ€”both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. For this reason (and because there were no built-in alternatives), Object has been used as Map historically.

// However, there are important differences that make Map preferable in some cases:

// - Accidental Keys (objects initialize with prototype)
// - Key types (previously just strings or symbols, now can be functions, objects, any primitive)
// - Key Order (simplified to order of entry insertion)
// - Size (inherent size property)
// - Iteration (objects aren't inherently iterable)
// - Performance (additions and removals are more performative)
// - Serialization and parsing (object wins in this case)
