// I love this one because it makes it so much easier to copy and paste multi-line strings into my code. I use this a lot on AdventOfCode challenges!

(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {

	let x = `hello
	world
	lchh loves you`;

// Another way that these are helpful are for templates (Thanks Chris Helming for the suggestion):
