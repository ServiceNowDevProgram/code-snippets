# Extracting Product Codes and Prices from a String

This script extracts product codes and prices from a given string of product descriptions. It utilizes a regular expression to match the format of the product codes (e.g., ABC-123) and their corresponding prices (e.g., $29.99). The results are logged using the gs.info() method in ServiceNow, providing clear output for each product.
