# commit-note-template

> A small text template you can paste in PR comments or commit messages to help maintainers understand your change quickly.

**Use case:**  
While submitting Hacktoberfest PRs, I realized reviewers appreciate clarity. This template summarizes your snippet purpose and what changed in 3 lines.
