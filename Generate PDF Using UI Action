To generate a PDF in ServiceNow, you can use the Print feature combined with a Scheduled Script or a Business Rule. Below is a basic code snippet that demonstrates how to generate a PDF of a record (like an incident) using a UI Action.

UI Action Snippet
Create a new UI Action in your ServiceNow instance.
Use the following code in the Script section of the UI Action:
javascript
Copy code
function generatePDF() {
    var recordSysId = g_form.getUniqueValue(); // Get the current record's sys_id
    var tableName = g_form.getTableName(); // Get the current table name

    // Construct the URL to generate the PDF
    var pdfUrl = '/api/now/pdf/' + tableName + '/' + recordSysId;

    // Open the PDF in a new window
    window.open(pdfUrl, '_blank');
}
Explanation:
Record Identification: g_form.getUniqueValue() retrieves the sys_id of the current record, while g_form.getTableName() gets the table name (e.g., incident, task).
PDF Generation URL: The URL is constructed to call the ServiceNow PDF API.
Opening the PDF: The PDF will open in a new browser window.
Additional Considerations:
Permissions: Ensure that the user has permission to view the record and generate PDFs.
PDF Template: You might want to customize the PDF template to include specific fields or formatting. You can do this by configuring the PDF generation template in the ServiceNow PDF settings.
UI Action Properties: Set the UI Action to be visible on the desired form, and choose an appropriate action name (e.g., "Generate PDF").
Testing:
After creating the UI Action, navigate to a record (like an incident) and test the action. It should generate and open the PDF with the current recordâ€™s information.
This snippet provides a straightforward way to generate a PDF for any record in ServiceNow!
