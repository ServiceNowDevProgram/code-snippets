Copied from their website: 

Juxtapose helps storytellers compare two pieces of similar media, including photos, and GIFs. It's ideal for highlighting then/now stories that explain slow changes over time (growth of a city skyline, regrowth of a forest, etc.) or before/after stories that show the impact of single dramatic events (natural disasters, protests, wars, etc.).
