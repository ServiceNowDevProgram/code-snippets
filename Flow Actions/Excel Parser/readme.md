This excel parser code helps reading the excel file. This works on xlsx files format. One can read excel columns and rows via this code. This code helps reading each row and putting all the rows in an array then you can perform any validation on the row array and after validation the data can be put into the ServiceNow tables.

We can write any validation on data stored in array "rows_info". We can also set the parent vs child relationship based on excel parser.

This is really beneficial when bulk data needs to be uploaded in system.
