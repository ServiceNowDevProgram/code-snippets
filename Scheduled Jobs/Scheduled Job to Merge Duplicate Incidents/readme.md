Description:

This scheduled job identifies and merges duplicate incidents in the ServiceNow instance based on specific criteria, such as matching short descriptions. The job operates as follows:

Query Active Incidents: It starts by querying the incident table for active incidents that potentially contain duplicates, using criteria that might indicate duplication (e.g., incidents with similar short descriptions).

Merge Logic: For each incident found, it searches for other active incidents with the same short description. If duplicates are detected, it applies merging logic:

Closes the duplicate incidents to avoid confusion and ensure that only one incident remains active for tracking.
Optionally, it can add comments or notes to the primary incident, indicating that other incidents have been merged into it, thus preserving historical context.
Logging: Throughout the process, the job logs actions taken for accountability and auditing, providing visibility into which incidents were merged.

Frequency: The job is scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly) to continuously monitor for duplicates, helping maintain the integrity of incident records.

This process improves data quality, reduces clutter in the incident management system, and enhances reporting accuracy by consolidating related incidents into a single record.
