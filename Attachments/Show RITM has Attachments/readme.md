This feature requires a "Display" Business rule on [sc_task] to pass the value to g_scratchpad and then an "onLoad" Client Script to display a message on the Catalog Task form.

The result is a message on message on the Catalog Task form (below the RITM field) indicating when a RITM has attachments.
