1. Function Declaration:This starts an anonymous function that is executed immediately. It's used for encapsulation, preventing global namespace pollution.
2. Array Definition :This array (`cmdbTables`) lists the names of various CMDB tables that the script will query to count the number of records. Each entry is a string representing a table name, with comments describing each table's purpose.
3. Iteration Over the Array: A `for` loop iterates through each table name in the `cmdbTables` array. The variable `i` serves as the loop index, and `tableName` holds the name of the current table being processed.
4. GlideRecord Query: A new `GlideRecord` instance (`gr`) is created for the current table (`tableName`) and The `query()` method is called to retrieve all records from that table.
5. Count Records:The `getRowCount()` method is called on the `GlideRecord` instance to get the total number of records retrieved by the query. This count is stored in the variable `count`.
6. Logging the Results: The result is logged to the ServiceNow system log using `gs.info()`, displaying the table name and the corresponding record count.
7. End of the Function: This closes the function and executes it immediately.
