This script provides a streamlined way to retrieve data from an external API and automatically save it as an attachment in ServiceNow. By leveraging the RESTMessageV2 API, this script can fetch information from a specified endpoint and attach the response directly to a designated record within ServiceNow.

This approach is ideal for scenarios where external data needs to be archived or referenced within ServiceNow, such as incident records, change requests, or tasks. Additionally, by automatically saving the response as an attachment, the script eliminates the need for manual data transfer, ensuring consistent data capture directly from the API. This script also includes optional configurations for setting headers or authentication, making it versatile and adaptable for various API requirements.
