Description: This UI Action provides users with the ability to reopen incidents that have been marked as "Closed."
It allows for more flexibility in incident management by enabling users to revisit issues that may have been prematurely closed or require further attention.
State Change: When activated, the UI Action changes the incident's state from "Closed" (usually represented by a value like 7 or Closed) back to "In Progress" (usually represented by a value like 2).
