Description: The Clone Incident UI Action allows users to create a new incident record that duplicates the details of an existing incident. 
This feature is particularly useful for support teams that need to log similar incidents frequently, saving time and ensuring consistency in incident reporting. 
By cloning an incident, users can quickly create a new record with pre-filled fields, making it easier to manage recurring issues or similar requests.

Key Features:
Duplication of Key Fields: The cloned incident retains essential information from the original, such as the short description, description, priority, caller ID, and assignment group.
User-Friendly: Provides a simple button on the incident form that allows users to create a copy of the incident with a single click.
Efficiency: Reduces the time spent entering repetitive data, allowing support teams to focus on resolving issues rather than data entry.
