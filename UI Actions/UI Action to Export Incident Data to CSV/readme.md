Key Features:
Full Incident Data Export: Users can export important details such as incident number, short description, priority, and state.
User-Friendly: A single button on the incident form enables users to initiate the export process quickly.
Formatted Output: The exported data is formatted as a CSV file, which can be opened in spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for further analysis.
