# Incident to Service Request Conversion UI Action using Cart() object

## Overview
This script automates the conversion of an **Incident** record into a **Service Request** and associated **Service Catalog Tasks**.
It copies essential details, work notes, additional comments, attachments, and emails from the original Incident to the new Service Request and Service Catalog Tasks, ensuring a seamless transition.


## Prerequisites
- Ensure that the catalog item Sys ID used in the script corresponds to a valid item in your ServiceNow instance.
- Modify the script according to your ServiceNow instance's requirements, especially for fields and Sys IDs.
