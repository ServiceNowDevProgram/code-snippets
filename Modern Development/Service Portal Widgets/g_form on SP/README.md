# g_form on Service Portal
Borrow code from the OOTB form widget to do interesting things with g_form on Service Portal.
This example widget is a quick demonstration of what can be done. I recommend looking into the OOTB form widget for more inspiration.

This widget demos to following:
* Being able to have UI actions anywhere on the page, not just the bottom of the form widget
* Add confirmation modals to UI Actions
* Disable/Enable buttons based on whether form is dirty or clean

***The code is intended to be on the same page as an instance of a form widget.***
