## Incident Sound Alerts Widget

This widget can be used to get sound alerts whenever a incident is created can be a major incident/high priority incident or a incident assigned to a particular group. We can place this widget on a portal page(which is open on a monitoring screen or system) and whenever the conditions are it will generate a sound alert.  Note: Currently the widget is configured to geneate alerts for Major incidents accepted.
