## Example of users query for GraphQL API

The code within this filder is just an example of working and basic implementation of sample user schema using `GraphQL API` in ServiceNow.
It consist of:
 - a schema (`schema.gql`)
 - 3 scripted resolvers (`.js` extension)
 - a json file representing the resolver mappings (key is _Path_, value is _Resolver_)
 - a json file representing the properties of the data broker (table `sys_ux_data_broker_graphql`)
 - a sample query (`get_user_broker_query.gql`)

## This is just an example

So read it, learn it and explore [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) ðŸ˜Š
