Use Case: Find the Total Number of Records in a Table Using the ATF Step "Run Server Side Script"

Using existing ATF steps (without scripting), it is very difficult to find the record count of a table.

By using the ATF test step "Run Server Side Script" with a simple script, we can count the records and also log/pass the count to the next ATF step if required.

Steps:

Navigate to Automated Test Framework >> Tests >> Click on New Test.
Give a name to the test and provide a description.
Go to the Test Steps related list and click Add Test Step.
Navigate to Server and choose Run Server Side Script.
Add the script (the script is in the script.js file).
Save the test and run it to see the results.
