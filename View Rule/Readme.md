View Rule determines which view of a form or list should be presented to the user based on certain conditions. A view in ServiceNow defines the layout and the fields that are displayed for a particular form or list. The View Rule allows administrators to dynamically choose the appropriate view for users based on specific criteria such as roles, query parameters, or data conditions.
