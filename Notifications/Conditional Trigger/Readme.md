This script is to be used in the Advanced condition field of the notification. This will help control if the notification is to be triggered or not to be triggered.
Replace the <catalog item name here> with particular catalog item for which you want this notification condition to work.
Replace the variable_name and ABCD with the values you want to compare and fire the notification accordingly.
