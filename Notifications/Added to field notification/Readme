This pull contains a business rule and a mail:script.

The business rule compares the old list to a newly saved list then calls an event to trigger a notification whenever someone new is added to a field/list. It will parse the user's first name so the mail script within the notification can address the recipient by first name if desired. 

The main:script contains a header banner, body and footer banner. The body is a response and can be used when there is an update to a case. It has a link to the case, description, location and embeds any attachments that are on the case.
