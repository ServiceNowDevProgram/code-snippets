# Displaying On-Call Schedule or Calendar next to the assignment group

This code provides a Jelly script UI Macros to display an on-call schedule button in ServiceNow table. It allows users to view the on-call schedule for a specific group by generating a URL to the on-call workbench.

## Features
- Generates a button in ServiceNow that opens the on-call schedule for a selected group.
- Uses GlideRecord to check for active on-call rotations.
- Constructs a URL with proper encoding to navigate to the on-call workbench.

I have used this code on the Incident Table
