This background or fix script will list forms that have more than a certain number of fields (starting threshold is 30, but can be changed on line 2).  It looks through all form sections, and excludes container starts and splits.  Forms / sections with more than 30(?) fields will appear on the Health Scan / Impact report as a possible performance impact, causing the form to take a noticeable amount of time to load.
