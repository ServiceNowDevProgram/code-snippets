The script retrieves and logs the size of the `sys_attachment_doc` table in ServiceNow by querying the `sys_physical_table_stats` table, which stores metadata about the physical size of tables in the instance.

   - The variable `table_name` is defined as `'sys_attachment_doc'`, which is the table that holds the data for attachments in ServiceNow.
   - A new GlideRecord instance `tabSizeinGB` is created for the `sys_physical_table_stats` table. This table contains information about the physical size of tables.
   - The script then adds a query to find the record where the `table_name` field matches `'sys_attachment_doc'`.
   - The `setLimit(1)` method ensures that only one record is returned, even if there are multiple records for the same table (though typically there should only be one).
   - The `query()` method executes the query, and the `if (tabSizeinGB.next())` condition checks if a matching record is found.
   - If a record is found:
     - It attempts to retrieve the value of the `table_size_in_gb` field (the size of the table in gigabytes) using the `getValue('table_size_in_gb')` method.
     - If the size is available, the script logs the table name and its size to the system logs using `gs.info()`.
     - If the size field is empty or not populated, it logs a message stating that the "Table size information is not available."
   - If no matching record is found, the script logs "Table not found!" indicating that the `sys_attachment_doc` table's size could not be retrieved.

- Purpose: The script is designed to retrieve and display the size of a specified table in gigabytes from the `sys_physical_table_stats` table.
