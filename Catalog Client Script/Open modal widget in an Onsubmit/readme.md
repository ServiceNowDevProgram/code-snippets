Code snippet to stop submission of a form in an Onsubmit Client Script, use an asynchronous call, and open a Widget in Modal view. In the script provided, there are two buttons in the modal. The first continues with the submission to create a new record and the second one cancels it. We can use a Script Include to get some value that we want and based on that open the modal or continue with submission.
