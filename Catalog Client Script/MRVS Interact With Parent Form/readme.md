Use this code snippet to interact with the parent form (i.e the main Cataloge Item) from within a Catalog Client Script that applies to a multi-row variable set.

The g_service_catalog object allows for accessing the "parent" GlideForm (g_form) object for getValue only (for now?)
To affect a variable in the main catalogue item using setValue, clearValue, etc. parent.g_form... is available in the native UI, and this.cat_g_form... can be used for Service Portal, etc if an additional Catalog Client Script is used, this one onLoad that Applies to the Catalog Item (not the MRVS).
