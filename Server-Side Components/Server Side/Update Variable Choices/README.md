Programatically update add a new choice for a service catalog variable and reorder all choices alphabetically. Can be helpful as part of a workflow where a fulfiller chooses logic to "update the list" variable, such as a small product or category list that may require ongoing updates as a result of fulfilling the request. Often unlisted choices are handled with an "Other" option and a text field to include the unlisted option. This script will take the value from the "Other" variable and add it to the choice list in the workflow.
