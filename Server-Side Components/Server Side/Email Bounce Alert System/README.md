ðŸ“§ Email Bounce Alert System
ðŸ“˜ Overview

The Email Bounce Alert System automatically detects bounced-back emails in the Junk Mail module and alerts administrators or support teams about affected recipients. It helps identify communication failures quickly and ensures that important client messages arenâ€™t missed due to IP blacklisting or delivery issues.
