# Get Current User Information
We frequently need essential current user information such as userId, name, sysId, email, and roles on the client side. To streamline this process, I've developed a Script Include that can be invoked directly from the client side.
This Script Include fetches and provides an object encapsulating the current user's userId, firstName, lastName, email, roles, and sysId for easy access.
