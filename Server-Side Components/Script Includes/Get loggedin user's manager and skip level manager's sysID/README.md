**Script explanation :**
When called via GlideAjax from a client script, it:

1) Takes the user’s sys_id as a parameter (sysparm_user_sys_id).
2) Queries the sys_user table for that record.
3) Extracts:
    The user’s direct manager (manager1)
    The manager’s manager (manager2)
4) Returns the results as a JSON string.

**Usage of this script :**
When the user wants to escalate they can utilize the manager or manager's sys_id depending upon their requirement.
