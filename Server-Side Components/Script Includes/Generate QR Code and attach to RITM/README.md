# Create QR Code
This sample script uses a free QR Code API and does a REST call to the server and returns the QR code as image. Then attaches
the QR code into Requested Item record.

In the script, replace the Requested Item sys_id with sys_id of your record. Change the text to the text you want to appear in the QR Code.
