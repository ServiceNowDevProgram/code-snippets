The scope of this utility ranges from multilingual support based on the user's preferred language to dynamic field translation through integration with Flows and Actions.

The scope of this PR & SI to provide a translationUtil, the custom flow action and subflow is not within the scope of this Util, if anyone wants to use it they need to create there own subflow that detect and translate the language by using this SI.

Details of Utils

TranslationUtils is a custom Script Include, created to manage dynamic text translation and language detection without depending on ServiceNowâ€™s Out-of-the-box (OOTB) Translation plugin (like Dynamic Translation or Localization framework).
How it Works?

It will look for Custom REST connections (via http_connection and api_key_credentials)
Flow actions / subflows for actual translation and detection (global.detect_language, global.hhfksjhd__translate_text)
Custom batching, size limits, and buffer logic to optimize translation requests and avoid API overflows.
This SI will do the translation & detection of texts & give the translated data as JSON output
HOPE THIS HELPS TO CLARIFY.
