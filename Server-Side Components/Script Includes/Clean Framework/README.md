This is a generally useful framework for script includes that in use in my day to day work as well as personal projects on my PDI. It allows you to easily enable logs when calling whichever method you want to use when developing and debugging, then easily disable them by no longer passing in the initilization debug true param or setting it to false in your call. It's very sleek and I highly recommend using it wherever you can to help keep a clean codebase. I also included some examples of how I docment each of my methods. I find it to be helpful when dealing with complex methods I haven't touched in awhile as well as making it easy for new developers to look at the code and hit the ground running quickly.
