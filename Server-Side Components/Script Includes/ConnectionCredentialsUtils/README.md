# Retrieve Connection and Credentials Information using Connection Alias (sys_id) in a Scoped Application
I've created a Script Include that enables users to retrieve connection and credentials details associated with a Scoped Application.

In addition to providing this information, the Script Include also decrypts and returns the value of the password2 field. It supports a wide range of credential types, including:

Basic Authentication credentials
API Key credentials
Windows credentials
SSH credentials, and more.

This tool simplifies access to important connection and credential data for all supported types in the scoped environment.
