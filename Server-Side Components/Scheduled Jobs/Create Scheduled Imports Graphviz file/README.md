# Graphviz graph of Scheduled Import parent/child relations

Create a Graphviz DOT graph of Scheduled Import with parent/child relations

**Not an actual Scheduled Job but rather to be run as a Background Script or in Xplore.**

Add "grSIS.addEncodedQuery(...)" lines as required to filter on specific Scheduled Imports.

Output is a Graphviz DOT file of all (or filtered) Scheduled Imports parent/child relationships.

The output file can for example be viewed on the following pages:
- https://edotor.net/
- https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
