This Scheduled Script Execution in ServiceNow is designed to automatically reset the bounced_email_count for active users who have exceeded a threshold. 
It helps maintain email hygiene and ensures that users with high bounce rates are flagged and reset for further investigation or remediation.


Purpose
To identify active users with a bounced_email_count greater than 8 and reset their state and count to allow for reprocessing or follow-up.
