Find out all the cases with the difference in their create date and current date and put them in different buckets of their age. Then you can report on the aging. With this you will be able to run the Bucket Group reporting on tables without using PA.

In ServiceNow Performance Analytics (PA), a Bucket Group is used to categorize or group data into defined ranges or segments, which helps make reports and indicators more meaningful and easier to analyze. This code will help you to categorize the tickets based on any defined ranges or segments you want. Based on this defined ranges or segments you can get any king of reporting without using PAs in ServiceNow.

This code lets you create custom ranges (buckets) to classify numerical data (like durations, scores, or counts) into meaningful labels.For example, instead of showing raw numbers like 2, 7, 14, 30 days, you can define buckets such as:

0–5 days → “Very Fast”

6–10 days → “Fast”

11–20 days → “Average”

>20 days → “Slow”

Then, these labels can be displayed in your dashboards, or reports, making the data easier to interpret.

Real time user cases:

1. Score or metric segmentation
Divide customer satisfaction scores into Low, Medium, High ranges.

2. Priority or risk scoring
Convert numeric risk scores into descriptive ranges (Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk).

Also, SLA uses the tickets to be defined in SLA number or breach date. It doesnt let you define any segment or categorize the data. It helps you define the reporting basis on your category or segment
