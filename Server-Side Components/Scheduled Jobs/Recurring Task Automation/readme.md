The Recurring Task Automation project automates the creation of recurring tasks in ServiceNow based on a predefined schedule or trigger. This ensures routine operational tasks, maintenance jobs, or checks are executed consistently without manual intervention.

Unlike OOB scheduled jobs for individual tasks, this solution is dynamic, flexible, and configurable per task type.
