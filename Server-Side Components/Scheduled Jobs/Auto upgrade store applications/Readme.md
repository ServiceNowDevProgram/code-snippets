This script will automatically upgrade the Store applications of your choice, based on a system property.

A few key points about this approach:
• The script upgrades only the applications listed in the system property (auto_upgrade_store_apps) and applications that are included as child.
• It can be scheduled to run automatically or triggered manually.
• You can add an email notification, a banner, or another form of alert to notify admins about which applications were updated.

This is a simple way to save time and keep Store applications up to date without manual intervention.
