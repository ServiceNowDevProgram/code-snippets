Description
The Incident Creation from Email with Attachments Handling functionality in ServiceNow allows users to create incident records directly from incoming emails. 
This automation streamlines the incident management process, enabling users to report issues efficiently without the need to log
into the ServiceNow platform. When an email is received, the script extracts critical information from the email, such as the subject and 
body, to populate the incident fields. Additionally, any attachments 
included in the email are automatically linked to the incident, ensuring that all relevant context is preserved and easily accessible for support teams.
