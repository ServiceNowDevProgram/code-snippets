I want to reply from sc_task(TASK) via Out look. In sc_tasK, reply information will be auto populated in "sc_task" table custom field.

Reply Template : Are you good to Processed ? Yes Date : 20/10/2025

Those template info will be set in Custom fields(Good to Processed, Effective Date) in sc_task table after reply & task should be closed.
