Many organizations still prefer copying over the attachments from RITM or any ticket type that has approval required to its corresponding approvals by using GlideSysAttachment.copy() 
This ideally makes sense till the time approval is needed however, when approvals are actioned (approved/rejected) there is no need for attachments to stay on the approval record till eternity (it will be stored at its ticket level). Use this script as a scheduled script to remove attachments from closed (approved/rejected) approval records and help consume less storage.
