# Clone User with Roles and Groups

A background script that clones an existing user's profile including all their roles and group memberships to a new user account.

## Usage

1. Navigate to **System Definition â†’ Scripts - Background**
2. Copy and paste the script content
3. Update the function call at the bottom with the source and target user IDs:
   ```javascript
   cloneUser('source.username', 'new.username');
   ```
4. Click "Run script"

## What It Does

The script:
1. Creates a new user record with the specified username
2. Copies all field values from the source user to the new user (except fields already set)
3. Clones all directly assigned roles (excludes inherited roles)
4. Clones all group memberships
5. Returns the sys_id of the newly created user
