Add the OOTB "Standard Change" model to an existing change record. OOTB, the Standard Change model is applied through an onDisplay business rule, and is not an available choice from the Model field. If you have migrated to use Change Models and generate some change requests with scripts, you may need to add the model with a background script if there is already an existing workflow context or if the model is not set by the generation script. The setter portion can be added to an existing generation script to prevent future need for this background script.
