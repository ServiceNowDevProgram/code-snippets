# ServiceNow Background Script – Create RITM via sn_sc.CartJS()

## Overview
This script demonstrates how to programmatically create a **Request Item (RITM)** and **Request (REQ)** in ServiceNow using the modern **`sn_sc.CartJS()` API**.

The script simulates a Service Catalog order submission — adding a catalog item to the cart and checking it out. This ensures that all **catalog flows, workflows, and business rules** are triggered exactly as if the request were placed through the Service Portal or native UI.
