Dear ServiceNow Community,


The GlideEncrypter API uses 3DES encryption standard with NIST 800-131 A Rev2 has recommended against using to encrypt data after 2023. ServiceNow offers alternative cryptographic solutions to the GlideEncrypter API.

Below are the sample scripts I ran in my PDI: For Password fields. 

Note: 'u_pass' is Password (2 Way Encrypted) field.
