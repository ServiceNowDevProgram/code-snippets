The script bookmarks the list of incidents assigned to the user's groups in ServiceNow's favorite tab. It works by :
  
--> Constructing a filter for incidents assigned to logged-in user's groups using the OOTB dynamic filter functionality.  
--> Checking if the list is already bookmarked.  
--> If not, it creates a new bookmark with the title : "Incidents assigned to my groups", adds the list url.  

This allows the user to quickly access the list of relevant incidents from the favorites tab.
