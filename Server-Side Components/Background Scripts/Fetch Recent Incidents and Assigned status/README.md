This piece of code is designed to fetch 'N' number of incidents that are most rcently created along with their Assigned status.
This helps to flag potential adherence issues which might lead to customer dissatisfaction.

What the code does:

1. Fetches the N number of most recently created incidents and prints their 'Number', 'Created' on value and 'Assigned to' status.
2. The incidents which are Assigned have a value of 'Assigned'.
3. The incidents which are Unassigned have a value of '**NOT Assigned**'.
