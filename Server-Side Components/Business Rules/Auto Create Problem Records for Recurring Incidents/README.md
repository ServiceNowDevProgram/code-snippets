This "after" business rule automatically creates a Problem record when a particular Configuration Item (CI) has had 5 or more incidents in the last 24 hours, and no open Problem already exists for that CI.
This helps in proactive problem management, aiming to address recurring issues.
Hereâ€™s the working of the code explained:

 - Check if CI is present in the current Incident (current.cmdb_ci).
 - Count incidents created in the last 24 hours for the same CI using GlideAggregate.

If 5 or more incidents are found for that CI:
 - Query the Problem table to check if an open Problem (not closed) already exists for that CI.
 - If no open Problem exists, create a new Problem record with: The same CI, A predefined short description And set its state to New (1).
 - Log a message indicating that a Problem has been created.
This automates Problem creation for frequent incidents on the same CI.
