Base64 Encode Before Save / Decode on Display

Explanation:

Goal: Store sensitive or formatted data (like text) in an encoded format in the database while still allowing users to see and interact with the readable version.

Before Insert/Update → Encode (secure storage).

Before Display → Decode (user-friendly display).

It’s a  example of data transformation for secure storage and transparent display.
