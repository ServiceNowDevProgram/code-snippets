The validator runs automatically on the sys_attachment table during record creation and checks each file extension against an allowed list defined in a system property.
If a file type is not allowed, the upload is blocked, the record creation is aborted, and a descriptive error is logged.
**Key Features:**
Serverâ€‘side enforcement (cannot be bypassed through APIs or imports).
Configurable allowed file extensions through a single system property.
Optional restriction to specific business tables.
Lightweight validation for secure instance operation.
**Functionality Summary**
Each attachment upload triggers the Business Rule before insert.
The file name and extension are extracted.
Allowed file extensions are read from the system property attachment.format.allowedExtensions.
The script checks whether the uploaded file complies with this configuration.
If disallowed, the upload is rejected and a clear error message appears in the system log or UI.
