This tool dynamically identifies dependencies across multiple ServiceNow tables such as Incidents, Problems, Changes, and CMDB CIs, and alerts users or teams if a record update might impact other related records.

Unlike OOB impact analysis, this is dynamic, real-time, and customizable for any relationships your organization cares about.
