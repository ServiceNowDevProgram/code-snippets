The purpose of this code is to conditionally apply a specific label (label_entry) to an Incident when the person updating the record is the same as the caller. If the update is made by someone else, the label is removed.
This mechanism helps fulfillers quickly identify caller driven updates, enabling faster and more targeted responses. Additionally, it can be leveraged in reporting to track caller engagement.
