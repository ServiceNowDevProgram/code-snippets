>**When a new Approval record (sysapproval_approver table) is created**

1. Create a Before Business Rule on the Approval (sysapproval_approver) table.

2. Check if the table of the record being approved is the Requested For table.

3. If it does:

	Verify whether the Approver (approver) is the same as the Opened by (opened_by) field on the related Requested For record.

	If both match:

		Automatically approve the approval record.

		Add appropriate approval comments (e.g., “Auto-approved since approver is the requestor (Opened By).”)

		Use setWorkflow(false) to prevent triggering additional workflows or business rules.
