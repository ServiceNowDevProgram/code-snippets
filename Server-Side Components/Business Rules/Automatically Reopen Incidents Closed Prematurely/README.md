If a user reopens a closed incident within 5 minutes of closure (e.g., because the issue wasn't actually resolved), automatically reopen it, log the reason, and notify the assigned user.
This code detects when an incident is reopened within 5 minutes of being closed. It compares the previous and current state of the record, and if it was previously Closed (state = 7) and is now Active, it calculates the time since closure. If the reopening happened within 5 minutes, it:
Triggers an event incident.reopened_quickly for notifications or logging.
Adds a work note explaining the automatic flag.
Sets a custom flag field u_reopened_flag to true for tracking.
This is useful for identifying and tracking incidents that are quickly reopened, possibly indicating incomplete resolution.
