This functionality automatically assigns newly created or updated tickets to the most available user within the assigned group, based on their current workload.

When a ticket is assigned to a group, the system evaluates all active members of that group, calculates the number of open or active tasks each member currently owns, and assigns the ticket to the user with the least workload. This ensures fair and efficient distribution of tasks across team members, helping prevent overload on specific users and improving overall response time.
