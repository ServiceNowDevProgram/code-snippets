# Script Explanation:
This script is written for a Business Rule in ServiceNow. The purpose of this rule is to assign the same assigned_to value (typically a user) from the request to all related requested items (RITMs)
in the same catalog for a specific catalog item.
This script could be used in scenarios where, once a request is assigned to a particular user (or group), you want all the individual requested items (RITMs) tied to that request to also automatically be assigned to the same user. 
This ensures consistency in assignment across the items in a request.
