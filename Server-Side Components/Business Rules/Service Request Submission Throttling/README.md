This business rule in ServiceNow is designed to limit the number of service catalog requests a user can submit within a certain timeframe â€” specifically, 5 requests per hour.

This rule helps throttle excessive catalog request submissions, which can:
Prevent system abuse (intentional or accidental),
Avoid spamming by users (especially in large environments)

This ServiceNow Business Rule checks if the current user has submitted 5 or more service catalog requests (sc_request) in the past hour. If they have:
It shows an error message, And aborts the current request from being submitted.
It uses GlideAggregate to efficiently count recent requests made by the same user, and compares the count against the limit.
