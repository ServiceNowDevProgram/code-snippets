### Global Variable in Transform Map

Demonstrates how to define and reuse a global variable (e.g., `this.managerMap`) across Transform Map scripts in ServiceNow.
By using `this` instead of `var`, the variable persists during the transform execution â€” enabling shared lookup data and improving performance.
Includes example onStart/onBefore scripts and screenshots.
