//The UI page includes a label prompting users to select an "SN Company," and utilizes the lightweight_glide_list2 macro to generate a dropdown list populated with active companies from the core_company table. The form also features "OK" and "Cancel" buttons in the modal footer, which trigger the onSubmit() and onCancel() functions, respectively, when clicked. This setup facilitates user interaction by enabling the selection of a company, which can be crucial for various processes within the ServiceNow platform.


<p><label for="company"><b>SN Company</b></label></p>
//This code creates a label for the company selection field, indicating that users should select a company from the list.
Company Selection Control:


<g:macro_invoke macro="lightweight_glide_list2" id="comId" name="comId" control_name="comCollector" reference="core_company" query="u_active=true" can_write="true" />
//This line invokes a macro called lightweight_glide_list2, which creates a dropdown or list control for selecting a company. The parameters specify that it should reference the core_company table, only show active companies (where u_active is true), and allow the user to write (make changes).

<div class="modal-footer">
    <span class="pull-right">
        <g:dialog_buttons_ok_cancel ok="return onSubmit();" cancel="return onCancel();" />
    </span>
</div>
//This section creates a footer for the modal dialog containing "OK" and "Cancel" buttons. The g:dialog_buttons_ok_cancel macro generates these buttons, calling the onSubmit() function to handle submission when the OK button is clicked and the onCancel() function to handle cancellation when the Cancel button is clicked.




var splitted = ['0c441abbc6112275000025157c651c89', '820351a1c0a8018b67c73d51c074097c'];
var displayText = ['3Com', 'Acer'];
//Two arrays are defined: splitted contains unique identifiers (likely Sys IDs), and displayText contains the corresponding display names for each identifier. For example, the first identifier corresponds to "3Com" and the second to "Acer."
Loop Through the Arrays:


for (var z = 0; z < splitted.length; z++) {
//A for loop is initiated to iterate through the elements of the splitted array. The loop runs as long as z is less than the length of the splitted array, ensuring that each item in both arrays is processed.
Get the Dropdown Element:

var selEl = document.getElementById('select_0comCollector');
//This line retrieves the HTML select element with the ID select_0comCollector. This element is where the new options will be added.
Create a New Option Element:


var optEl = document.createElement('option');
//A new <option> element is created, which will represent a selectable item in the dropdown menu.
Create and Append Display Text:


var txtNd1 = document.createTextNode([displayText[z]]);
//A text node is created using the corresponding display name from the displayText array, indexed by z. This node will be the visible text for the option.
Set Option Value:


optEl.setAttribute('value', [splitted[z]]);
//The value of the newly created option is set to the corresponding identifier from the splitted array, indexed by z.
Append Text Node to Option Element:


optEl.appendChild(txtNd1);
//The text node containing the display name is appended to the option element, so it will be displayed in the dropdown.
Append Option to Select Element:

selEl.appendChild(optEl);
//Finally, the fully constructed option element is appended to the dropdown select element, making it visible in the user interface.
