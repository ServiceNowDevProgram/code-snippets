When you have a MID Server scipt include and you want to call it from your Business Rule. 
You can use Javascript Probe to call that script Include. In my example I had to send some data out from ServiceNow and place it on Server
So I was using this Javasript Probe to call my code written in MID Server Script Include. As soon as I call this JAvascript Probe
It inserts the record in ecc_queue table which tells me whether the request send is successsful or not.
