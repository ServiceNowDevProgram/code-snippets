You can use this script in a Business Rule, Script Include, or any server-side logic that executes when creating or updating a record.

javascript:
// Function to calculate the next business day
function getNextBusinessDay(date) {
    var businessCalendar = new GlideBusinessCalendar(); // Create an instance of the business calendar
    var nextBusinessDay = new GlideDateTime(date); // Start from the provided date

    // Increment the date until a business day is found
    nextBusinessDay.addDays(1); // Move to the next day

    // Check if it's a business day, if not, keep adding days
    while (!businessCalendar.isBusinessDay(nextBusinessDay)) {
        nextBusinessDay.addDays(1); // Keep adding days until we find a business day
    }

    return nextBusinessDay;
}

// Example usage
var currentDateTime = new GlideDateTime(); // Get the current date and time
var nextBusinessDueDate = getNextBusinessDay(currentDateTime); // Calculate the next business day

// Set the Due Date field to the calculated next business day
current.sys_due_date = nextBusinessDueDate; // Assuming 'current' is the GlideRecord for the record being updated or created
Explanation:
getNextBusinessDay(date): This function calculates the next business day.

It creates an instance of GlideBusinessCalendar.
It starts with the provided date, increments it by one day, and checks if it is a business day.
If itâ€™s not a business day, it continues to add days until it finds one.
currentDateTime: This variable captures the current date and time.

nextBusinessDueDate: This variable stores the result of the getNextBusinessDay function.

current.sys_due_date: This sets the Due Date to the calculated next business day. Ensure that current refers to the GlideRecord you are modifying (e.g., an incident, task, or any record).
