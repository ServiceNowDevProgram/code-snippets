Description:

This business rule is designed to automatically assign incidents to different support groups based on the time they are created, ensuring that incidents are handled by the appropriate team depending on whether they fall within regular business hours or after hours.

Trigger: The rule runs Before Insert when a new incident is created.

Logic:

It checks the current hour of the day using the getHourPart() method.
If the hour is between 9 AM and 5 PM (inclusive), the incident is assigned to the "IT Support Group" (identified by its Sys ID).
If the incident is created outside of these hours (before 9 AM or after 5 PM), it is assigned to the "After Hours Support Group."
Purpose: This ensures that incidents are promptly assigned to the appropriate resources, optimizing response times and improving customer service during and after regular business hours.

This approach helps streamline operations by clearly defining responsibilities and ensuring incidents are handled by the right team, based on availability.
