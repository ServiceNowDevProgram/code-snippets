Business Rule: Validate CI on Deployed Assets

Overview
This Business Rule enforces CMDB integrity by ensuring that any asset marked as "Deployed" must be linked 
to a valid "Configuration Item (CI)". If no CI is associated, the rule automatically notifies the assigned 
user's manager to take corrective action.

This consists of 3 steps:
1. Business rule
2. Event setup
3. Email Notification

1.Business Rule Configuration 
Table: alm_asset
Type: Business Rule
When to run: After Update
Condition : current.install_status == 'Deployed' && !current.ci

2. Event Setup
   Go to System Policy > Events > Event Registry
Click New
Name: asset.ci.missing
Table: alm_asset
Description: Triggered when deployed asset has no CI

3.Email Notification
Go to System Notification > Email > Notifications
Create a new notification:
Name: Missing CI on Deployed Asset
Table: alm_asset
When to send: Event is fired â†’ asset.ci.missing
Recipients: Event.parm1 (manager)
Subject: Asset ${number} is deployed without a CI
Message: 
Hello ${recipient.name},
The asset ${number} assigned to ${assigned_to.name} is marked as Deployed but has no linked Configuration Item.
Please review and take appropriate action.
Regards,
IT Asset Management
