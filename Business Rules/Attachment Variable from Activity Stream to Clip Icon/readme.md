When attaching a file via an attachment type variable, on the target record the attachment appears in the Activity Stream instead of at the top associated with the paper clip icon, where one typically looks for / notices attachments.  This Business Rule will convert the entry in the sys_attachment table so that the attachment added via an attachment type variable appears at the top of the record, associated with the paper clip icon.
