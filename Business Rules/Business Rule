A business rule to trigger an event on a notification when someone is added to a list. It also parses a user's first name.

(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {

    // Assuming you are getting the list of added users from the watchlist
    var addedUsers = current.<list field name>.split(',');

    // Loop through the added users to trigger the event for each
    addedUsers.forEach(function(userID) {
        // Get the user record to retrieve first name
        var userGr = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
        if (userGr.get(userID)) {
                  
            // Fire an event for each user with their first name
            gs.eventQueue('<event name>â€™, current, userID, userGr.first_name);
        }
    });

})(current, previous);
