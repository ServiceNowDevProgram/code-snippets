Description
The Bulk User Deactivation Script is designed to automate the process of deactivating user accounts that have been inactive for a specified period, 
such as six months. This is crucial for organizations looking to enhance security, ensure compliance with regulations, and maintain an efficient 
user management system. By regularly deactivating accounts that are no longer in use, 
organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and keep their user database clean.

1. Automated Inactivity Checks : Automatically identifies inactive user accounts based on login activity.
2. Customizable Inactivity Period : Easily modify the inactivity threshold (e.g., 3 or 6 months) to suit organizational policies.
3. Comprehensive User Queries : Efficiently queries the `sys_user` table for users based on last login and active status.
4. Logging and Auditing: Logs each deactivation event, creating a clear audit trail for compliance.
5. User-Friendly Output : Provides detailed logs for administrators to track deactivated accounts.
6. Safety Mechanisms : Includes checks to prevent unnecessary deactivation of users.
7. Integration Potential : Can be integrated with workflows to notify users or admins before deactivation.
