1. Overview
This mail script is designed for use in ServiceNow notifications. It dynamically generates an HTML structure that displays key record details (Short Description, Description, and Comments) in a visually appealing format. The script can be used in any ServiceNow notification to provide recipients with a clear, styled summary of the record's information.

2. How It Works
Key Fields:

Short Description: Retrieves and displays the recordâ€™s short description.
Description: Retrieves the full description of the record, preserving white spaces and line breaks.
Comments: Retrieves the comments added to the record.

The content is wrapped inside a <div> container, with styling applied using the HTML <font> tag to set the font size, bold text, and color.
The use of gs.getMessage() allows for internationalization, ensuring that the script works well in multi-language environments.
3. Steps to Implement
Create a Notification:

Navigate to System Notification > Email > Notifications in ServiceNow.
Create a new notification or edit an existing one based on your requirements.
Insert the Mail Script:

In the notification, go to the Message tab.
Use the Mail Script type to call the script in your notification message.
The script will dynamically pull the details from the current record (such as incident or task).
Adjust the Script:

If needed, modify the script to display other fields or refine the content (e.g., fetching only specific journal comments).
You can add additional fields like Priority, Assigned to, or custom fields using a similar method.
4. Testing the Script
Send a Test Email:

After configuring the notification, trigger the event to send a test email.
Ensure the email is formatted correctly and that the Short Description, Description, and Comments are displayed as expected.
Positive Test Case:

Create or update a record that matches the notification conditions.
Verify that the email contains the correct record details in the styled format.
Negative Test Case:

Ensure that if no comments or description are available, the script does not throw errors but handles the empty fields gracefully.
5. Benefits
Improved Formatting: The use of HTML ensures that the notification looks professional, with clear headings and properly formatted text.
Dynamic Content: The script automatically pulls data from the record, reducing manual intervention and the risk of errors.
Internationalization: The use of gs.getMessage() allows for easy translation and localization of the content, making the script adaptable to global implementations.
Reusability: This script can be reused across multiple notifications and customized easily to include additional fields or change the format.
This approach enhances the quality of ServiceNow notifications, providing clear and well-structured information to end users.
