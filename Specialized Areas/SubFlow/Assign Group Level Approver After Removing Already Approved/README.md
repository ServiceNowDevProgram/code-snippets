Use Case:

When a catalog item requires a two-level approval process — Primary Level (Single Approver) and Secondary Level (Group/Department Approvers) — the system should exclude the Primary Approver from the Secondary Approval Group, if the same user is a member of both levels.



Example:

A catalog item first requires Manager ABC’s approval as the Primary Approver.

Next, it moves to the Department/Group Approval stage.

If Manager ABC is also part of the Group/Department Approvers, they should be excluded from the second-level approval to prevent duplicate approvals.
