# Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are simply browser bookmarks. They are created using javascript to make them more robust than simple links. They can execute within the context of the current active window and tab of your browser, which makes them very powerful and convenient.

## Why use bookmarklets?
- Do you work on multiple instances (dev, test, prod, customers, partners, etc.)?
- Do you have favorites that you use frequently?
- Do you get delayed when you work on a new or different instance and haven't setup your favorites yet?
- Have you had your favorites wiped out by a clone?

## Answer
- Keep your favorites in your browser rather than in the instance!

## How do I use bookmarklets?
The HTML file contains a set of bookmarklets that are instance agnostic. As long as you have an instance tab currently active, the bookmarklets will use the same instance. 

- Some are simple navigation while others are actions (i.e. show the contents of the scratchpad in an info message box or make all hidden fields visible). 
- The navigation bookmarklets will open in new tabs so you will not lose your place.
- Some are meant to be used within a specific page context. For example, showing the scratchpad contents in an info message box only works on the Platform UI Forms.

## How do I add these bookmarklets to my browser?
- Open the HTML file and simply drag a bookmarklets to your bookmarks bar to create the bookmarklet.
- Sort and group them as desired. They work in subfolders too.
- Open an instance and login.
- From any page on the instance, select the bookmarklet to activate it.
