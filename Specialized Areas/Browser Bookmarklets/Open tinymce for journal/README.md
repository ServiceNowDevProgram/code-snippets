# tinymce journal editor Bookmarklet Modal

This script is a bookmarklet that injects a draggable modal into a form (or ui page with access to ScriptLoader api in the content frame) with a tiny mce editor and buttons to insert the html to the journal fields on the form.

The dependency for tinymce is loaded from the instance itself and a html field does not need to be present on the form.
