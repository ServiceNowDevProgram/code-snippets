# Merge Stages/choices into one choice

Sometimes we start with flow/process where we have multiple stages for a particular document.
After the document is in production and we merge multiple stages into one to refine process we may need to modify stale data to keep it in sync with new process.

Use old stages and new stages (or choice values)
E.g.
Old Stage: New(new), Open(open), Draft(draft)
New Stage: Initiate(initiate)

This script will help to correct data and will update old stages data with new stage value.
