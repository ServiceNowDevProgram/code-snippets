This script checks data completeness in the CMDB by identifying missing key fields (like `os` and `location`) across selected CI classes (e.g., servers, applications). It counts how many CIs exist per class and how many are missing each field, helping administrators quickly spot and address data quality issues. This supports CMDB health, audit readiness, and overall data reliability.
