This script is used in ServiceNow to automatically fill in the missing manufacturer information for Configuration Items (CIs) in the CMDB (Configuration Management Database).

1. Predefined Mapping:
The script starts with a list of known model names and their corresponding manufacturer names.For example, a model called ThinkPad T14 is made by Lenovo, and MacBook Pro 16 is made by Apple
2. Look Up Manufacturer:
    * It defines a function that looks up the manufacturerâ€™s record in the core_company table (based on the name) and gets its unique ID (sys_id).
3.  Find CIs Missing a Manufacturer:
    * The script goes through all CIs in the cmdb_ci table where the manufacturer field is empty.
4.  Update Missing Manufacturer:
    * For each of those CIs:
        * It checks the model name.
        * If the model is in the predefined mapping:
            * It looks up the correct manufacturer in the core_company table.
            * It updates the CI record by setting the manufacturer field with the correct sys_id.
            * It also logs that the update was successful.
        * If the manufacturer is not found in the system, it logs a warning.
5.  Final Log:
    * After going through all matching CIs, it logs how many records were successfully updated.
