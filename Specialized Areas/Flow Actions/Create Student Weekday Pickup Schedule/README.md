## Flow Action Script to Create Weekday student pickup schedule

This code is part of a scope app where we create a pickup schedule for active Students

This is part of a scheduled flow that runs on Sunday night and created a set of records for each active student and builds a pickup schedule accoreding to the School Start and end times.
It also accounts for early release days such as Wednesday at 2:00pm 

This script can be modified to fit your specific needs.
