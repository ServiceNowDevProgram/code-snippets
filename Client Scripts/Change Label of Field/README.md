# Change Label of Field 

â€¢ Using g_form.setLabelOf() method we can change the field. We have to pass two parameters in this first paramater is the field which we want to change and second parameter is the label we want. Like in the code first parameter is "description" and second is "Please Explain Breifly". When the form loads if priority of the incident record is 1 then it changes description label to "Please Explain Breifly"
