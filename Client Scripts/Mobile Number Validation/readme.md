Validating mobile numbers involves checking that the input conforms to specific patterns or formats, which can vary based on country or organizational requirements. Below, I'll provide a comprehensive overview of mobile number validation in ServiceNow, including considerations for different formats, examples of regular expressions, and implementation in client scripts.
Overview of Mobile Number Validation
Mobile numbers can differ significantly across regions, often including:
Country codes (e.g., +1 for the USA, +44 for the UK)
Varying lengths (e.g., 10 digits in the USA, 11 digits in the UK)
Optional formatting characters (e.g., spaces, dashes)
Considerations for Mobile Number Validation
Country Codes: Include checks for valid country codes.
Length: Enforce a specific length depending on the country.
Character Validation: Ensure only numerical characters (and allowed formatting characters) are present.
International Formats: Support formats like E.164, which standardizes international phone numbers.
