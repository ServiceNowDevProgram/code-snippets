# Adding Placeholder Text in Resolution Notes

To maintain consistency and ensure specific information is captured in resolution notes, process owners may require fulfillers to follow a predefined format when resolving tickets.

By adding **placeholder** text in the resolution notes, fulfillers are reminded of the required information(e.g., Root cause, Steps taken, Resolution provided), reducing the risk of missing important details. The placeholder disappears as soon as the fulfiller begins entering their notes, ensuring it doesn't interfere with their input.

## How It Works

### When?
- The placeholder text is automatically added when the state of the ticket changes to Resolved (6).

### What Happens?
- A placeholder text appears in the resolution notes field to guide the fulfiller.
- As soon as the fulfiller starts typing, the placeholder disappears.
- This ensures consistency and alignment with the process requirements.
