This script include provides a way to delete multiple records asynchronously, with the option to define chunk sizes. 
It is useful for deleting huge amount of data without overoading the instance.
Since this is a script for DELETE operations, use with caution!
NB. The process needs to be triggered by one-time scheduled job.
