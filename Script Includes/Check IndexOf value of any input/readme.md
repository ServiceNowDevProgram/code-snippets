USECASE
--------
The scripts will take input value and convert it into a String then make it lowercase to find the occurring string. 
The script can accept array as a input since it first conversts and then checks for match.

OUTCOME
-------
If any match found, it will return an integer greater than 0.
If a match isn't found it will return -1.
