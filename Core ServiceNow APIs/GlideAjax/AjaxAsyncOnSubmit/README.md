On submit client scripts do not support in making asynchronous calls to server on both platform and portal due to its nature of execution. This had always been a problem and there was a need to make validations work asynchronously on submitting a form/record. The support for getXMLWait() had also been removed which prevents the usage of synchronous GlideAjax call on a service portal. The snippet provides a workaround to execute async calls in both forms and catalog items, thus enabling server side validations during onsubmit.
