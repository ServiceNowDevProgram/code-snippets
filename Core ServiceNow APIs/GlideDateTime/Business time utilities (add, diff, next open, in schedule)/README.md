# Business time utilities (add, diff, next open, in schedule)

## What this solves
Teams repeatedly reimplement the same business-time maths. This utility wraps `GlideSchedule` with four practical helpers so you can:
- Add N working hours to a start date
- Calculate working minutes between two dates
- Find the next open time inside a schedule
- Check if a specific time is inside the schedule window

All functions return simple objects that are easy to log, test, and consume in Flows or Rules.

## Where to use
- Script Include in global or scoped app
- Call from Business Rules, Flow Actions, or Background Scripts

## Functions
- `addWorkingHours(scheduleSysId, hoursToAdd, startGdt, tz)`
- `workingMinutesBetween(scheduleSysId, startGdt, endGdt, tz)`
- `nextOpen(scheduleSysId, fromGdt, tz)`
- `isInSchedule(scheduleSysId, whenGdt, tz)`

## Notes
- The schedule determines both business hours and holidays.
- `tz` is optional; if omitted, the scheduleâ€™s TZ or instance default applies.
- All inputs accept either `GlideDateTime` or ISO strings (UTC-safe).
