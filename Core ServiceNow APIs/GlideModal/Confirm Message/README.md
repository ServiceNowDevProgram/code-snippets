This script will be helpful to get a confirm box with the help of GlideModal, this can be leveraged in your client side scripts or UI actions. Confirm and alerts, which we get by 
using standard Javascript window methods can be easily blocked by user's browser, but GlideModal confirm will still display and this enhances the User experience.

With the help of this script we can get a confirmation pop-up with "Don't save", "Cancel", and "Save" buttons.
