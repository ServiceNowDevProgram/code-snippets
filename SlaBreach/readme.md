# Custom SLA Breach Alert

This script monitors SLAs and sends a notification to assignees if an SLA is about to breach within the next hour. It allows users to take preemptive action to meet SLA commitments.

## Usage
- Place this script in a Script Include or scheduled job to monitor SLA breaches.
- Customize the query for different SLA thresholds.
