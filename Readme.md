Synchronize additional comments from RITM to SCTASK and SCTASK to RITM. This can be achieved by writing an after business rule which is triggered whenever comments added on the RITM.The script finds the SCTASKs associated with the current RITM and updates the additional comments.
Another business rule will be triggered whenever comments added on SCTASK and the script posts the comments on to the RITM.
