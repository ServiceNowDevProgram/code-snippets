This script include will return PDF of knowledge article whose sys_id is passed.
You need to pass two paramters to 1) Knowledge Article Sys_id 2) Export Mode(Landscape, Portrait).
I have attached sample background script to call this SI with paramters.
Output of this utility will generate PDF of KB article body and insert in sys_attachment table.

This script include can be called from service portal widgets as well do download KB article in PDF format.
